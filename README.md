# Enumerable: An experiment in Go

The idea is to see how feasible it is to create something like Ruby's
[`Enumerable`](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.5/Enumerable.html) in Go.
In order to do this in a generic way requires use of Go's
[`reflect`](https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/) package.

## Goals

  * a better understanding of `reflect` and the related performance issues
  * an easy to use package which at the very least could be used when some
performance can be traded for ease of use and readability (i.e. when IO is
already the bottleneck, this will probably be fast enough)
  * where possible, fast implementations will be provided so that they can
be used even when top performance is required

## Examples

  * Count total letters
```go
var list = []string{"one", "two", "three"}
letterCount := enumerable.New(list).Map(func(item string) int {
  return len(item)
}).Reduce(0, func(memo, l int) int {
  return memo + l
} // letterCount = 11
```

  * get a sorted list of unique words in files
```go
nonAlphabet := regexp.MustCompile("[^a-zA-Z]")
files, _ := filepath.Glob("*.txt")
words := enumerable.New(files).Map(func(file string) []string {
  contents, err := ioutil.ReadFile(file)
  if err != nil {
    panic(err)
  }
  return nonAlphabet.Split(string(contents), -1)
}).Flatten().Uniq().Sort().JoinAsString(", ")
```
